# Sound-Room

Small Sound Room built around a recliner chair.

The concept is to use 96, 12 inch by 12 inch Soundproof Panels, I found them for $66 at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09RKLX6RT/), 
represented by the squares, you make a frame, 
and put the panels on them, on the inside and outside, to stop sound from entering from outside, 
and to keep sound from echoing around the room you are in.

These images do not show the ventaltaion system yet.

The first image is when the box is closed, it measures 6-foot tall by 4-foot wide, and a normal recliner fits inside,
the concept will include a boom mount for the recorder, and you use a laptop, smartphone, or tablet to read from.

This image shows you remove the front section, by opening up the top.

Then store it on back.

Things that will be included in this design:

* Ventalation
* Lights
* Microphone boom
* Micophone holder
* Laptop, Smartphone, or Tablet holder

The soundproofing panels attach to a frame, this can plywood, or plastic, it requires an air gap, 
so you need two panels, plus you need to attach the soundproofing on the inside and outside.
