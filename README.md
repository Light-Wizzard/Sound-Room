# Sound-Room

Small Sound Room built around a recliner chair.

The concept is to use 96, 12 inches by 12-inch Soundproof Panels, I found them for $66 at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09RKLX6RT/), 
represented by the squares, you make a frame, 
and put the panels on them, on the inside and outside, to stop sound from entering from outside, 
and to keep sound from echoing around the room you are in.

These images do not show the ventilation system yet.

The first image is when the box is closed, it measures 6-foot tall by 4-foot wide, and a normal recliner fits inside,
the concept will include a boom mount for the recorder, and you use a laptop, smartphone, or tablet to read from.

## Features

Things that will be included in this design:

* Ventilation
* Lights
* Microphone boom
* Microphone holder
* Laptop, Smartphone, or Tablet holder

The soundproofing panels attach to a frame, this can plywood, or plastic, it requires an air gap, 
so you need two panels, plus you need to attach the soundproofing on the inside and outside.

To make this affordable, you have to make comprises, 
plywood is cheap, and the results will not be good,
the best system is to use sheets of plastic,
you can use Polycarbonate, it is the best, most expensive, I will skill Plexiglass,
because Fiberglass is cheap, lite, and can be made to make two air-tight chambers,
that will isolate loud sounds, and it is not hard to take sheet fiberglass,
shape it, and mold it, to make airtight chambers that get coupled together using neoprene spacers.
To cut down on cost, I have one source on Amazon [True Composites Fiberglass Polyester Resin-Marine Grade Repair Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Composites-Fiberglass-Repair-Polyester-1-5x50x10/dp/B079CQ8P5M), 
to give you an idea of the cost, and what you want,
this is marine grade, does not need to be, 
whatever works and is cheap.

## Concepts

The concept of Sound Proofing has three main goals:

1. Isolation
2. Reflection
3. Background

Isolation is the hardest, this means you hear nothing from outside, to try to achieve this,
we will make two chambers that mount together with an isolator.

Reflection is what causes an echo, even in a small room, you have sounds that bounce off the walls, 
all you need is Soundproofing foam.

Background noise is on the inside, this is your equipment, 
and the ventilation system.

There are many types of Soundboards on the market, 
I am looking for a system that is lite, easy to use, 
and does not cause any health issues with fibers,
and fiberglass, will not have these issues, 
they are completely covered, to begin with.

What I want to achieve, is all three. Isolation, making a room inside a room, is the first step,
this requires a floor, sound can come up from the floor,
but you can skip this part, to save money, but keep in mind,
if you feel things in your home, you need this isolation from the floor.
If you cover the inside and outside with foam, you cut down on a lot of sounds,
but without the proper isolation, you still have loud sounds.

### Isolation

You will want to use Neoprene Rubber to make an Airtight outer room.

## Ventalation

I need two 4" inline fans, and a 4" flex hose, for intake and exhaust.

4" inline fans like these:

I need some 4" flexible tubing also known as a Dryer hose.

I show the intake as Green, it comes in from the bottom,
whereas the exhaust is taken from the top.

## Size

The size depends on your needs, mine are simple, I want a Sound Room that my recliner will fit into, and I can stand up, 
so it needs to be 48" wide, 6' long, and 6' tall, if you are taller, you might want to make it 8, but I am 5'9", 
so 6 works for me, but make this fit your needs.

## Construction

I decided to make this a modular building, so I am making walls, and I have two designs for walls, 
the first is plywood, I have some, so that is what I will use, 
but I will also design what I will call Sound Isolation Panels.

I call this project a Sound-Room, it can be built in two stages,
the inside, and the outside.

The outside is called the Isolation Room, the way I want to make this,
is using Fiberglass panels,
we made an air chamber, by taking a fiberglass square tubbing, the size will make the air gap, so 1" is good,
you then add a sheet of fiberglass to the front and back, 
you make two of these and connect them using a decoupler,
Neoprene Rubber Spacers will work,
now we can use Plywood, 
and we know this will not work,
but I want to use Neoprene Rubber to wrap this panel in,
so if I wrap the fiberglass panels,
I will have a better system.

The Inside is called the Environment Room, this is suspended off of Neoprene spacers,and the outside must only connect to it, using these Sound decoupling spacers.
You have to design the front wall and add the mount for a monitor, this will also require exhaust air for heat, which will require a heat collector and a holder for a boom microphone, so this panel is what you will be looking at all day, and with no Windows, hang a Picture of outside, but I will not put a glass window to see through in a Sound Room, it defeats the purpose of a Sound Room, why not make a Glass soundproof box.

The walls must have seals, this is going to be part of a frame, this can be made of many materials, 
Aluminum or Steel, we do not want to use wood, due to the bulk it would require to be strong enough, 
this must hold the weight of the inside and outside room, plus the person inside it.
