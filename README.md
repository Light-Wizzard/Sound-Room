# Sound-Room
Small Sound Room built around a recliner

The concept is to use 12 inch by 12 inch Soundproof Panels, represented by the squares, you make a frame, 
and put the panels on them, on the inside and outside, to stop sound from entering from outside, 
and to keep sound from echoing around the room you are in.

These images do not show the ventaltaion system yet.

The first image is when the box is closed, it measures 6-foot by 3-foot, and a normal recliner fits inside,
the concept will include a boom mount for the recorder, and you use a smartphone or table to read from.
