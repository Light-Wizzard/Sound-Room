# Sound-Room

Small Sound Room built around a recliner chair.

The concept is to use 96, 12 inch by 12 inch Soundproof Panels, I found them for $66 at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09RKLX6RT/), 
represented by the squares, you make a frame, 
and put the panels on them, on the inside and outside, to stop sound from entering from outside, 
and to keep sound from echoing around the room you are in.

These images do not show the ventaltaion system yet.

The first image is when the box is closed, it measures 6-foot tall by 4-foot wide, and a normal recliner fits inside,
the concept will include a boom mount for the recorder, and you use a laptop, smartphone, or tablet to read from.

This image shows you remove the front section, by opening up the top.

Then store it on back.

Things that will be included in this design:

* Ventalation
* Lights
* Microphone boom
* Micophone holder
* Laptop, Smartphone, or Tablet holder

The soundproofing panels attach to a frame, this can plywood, or plastic, it requires an air gap, 
so you need two panels, plus you need to attach the soundproofing on the inside and outside.

To make this affordable, you have to make comprises, 
plywood is cheap, and the results will not be good,
the best system, is to use sheets of plastic,
you can use Polycarbonate, it is the best, most expensive, I will skill Plexiglass,
becasue Fiberglass, is cheap, lite, and can be made to make two air tight chambers,
that will isolate loud sounds, and it is not hard to take sheet fiberglass,
shape it, and mold it, to make to air tight chambers that get coupled together using neupremem spacers.
To cut down on cost, I have one one soure on Amazon [True Composites Fiberglass Polyester Resin-Marine Grade Repair Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Composites-Fiberglass-Repair-Polyester-1-5x50x10/dp/B079CQ8P5M), 
to give you an idea of cost, and what you want,
this is marine grade, does not need to be, 
whatever works and is cheap.

The concept of Sound Proofing, has three main goals:

1. Isolation
2. Reflection
3. Background

Isolation is the hardest, this means you hear nothing from outside, to try to achive this,
we will make two chambers that mount together with an isolator.

Reflection is what causes an echo, even in a small room, you have sounds that bounce off the walls, 
all you need is Soundproofing foam.

Background noise is on the inside, this is your equipment, 
and the ventaltion system.

There are many types of Soundboards on the market, 
I am looking for a system that is lite, easy to use, 
and does not cause any health issues with fibers,
and fiberglass, will not have these issues, 
they are completly covered to begin with.

What I want to achive, is all three. Isolation, making a room inside a room, is the first step,
this requries a floor, sound can come up from the floor,
but you can skip this part, to save money, but keep in mind,
if you feel things in your home, you need this isolation from the floor.
If you cover the inside and outside with foam, you cut down on a lot of sound,
but without the proper isoloation, you still have loud sounds.
