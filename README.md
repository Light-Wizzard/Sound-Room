# Sound Room

A Sound Room means many things to many people, I could build a box that makes a sound, technically that is a speaker, and this room could have speakers in it, and used to listen to sounds, while not having to hear the sounds outside this Sound Room, but that is a use for it and not the design of it, so I need to explain what this Sound Room is. 

This Sound Room is an Isolation room, with a sound absorption room inside it, so you have two layers of sound projection while giving both types of protection, thus, it is a room inside a room, the outside is covered in Neoprene Rubber, and the inside is covered in Soundproofing foam. 

This box can be any dimension, this one is the smallest you can make for my purpose, it holds a recliner to sit in while having enough room to stand up in, even have monitors front and back, for this reason, so what this, is an office cubicle, a personal space, where you isolate yourself from the sound of the outside world you live in, and what you use it for, is up to you, but I will give you a few examples.

Why would you want a Sound Room? If you live on this planet, you will have a hard time finding a place that is quiet, even isolation chambers are not always soundproof, but true sound isolation is hard to achieve and expensive, but what if you can build one for under $600, will this buy you peace of mind?
Why do you want quiet? Audio recording.

Everyone on this planet would like to have a room like the one being built in this GitHub Project, for one reason, it has a recliner, it has a large screen display, I can crank up the sound, and no one outside the box, can hear what is being blasted inside the box, and it works both ways, step into quiet, just sit there and listen to the noise in your head, and your breathing, other than that, you only bring what makes noise into this space.

You have three problems with sound, and why you need this Sound Room, it is small at 4 feet wide, 7 feet long, and 7 feet tall, it is a box, with a box inside it, the outside door closes from both sides, no locks, this is for safety in case you pass out, the only air is being piped in, and you should have oxygen and CO2 monitor in this space, you can get them cheap enough, accuracy is one issue, the cost is the other, but for safety reasons, I have to assume you have one and warn to never get into a closed space, without one, that said, I will write a section devoted to this. 

The ventilation system should deal with this issue, you have intake and exhaust, and only one needs to work, so you have a redundant system, plus you can adjust them differently, so you add a filter, and breathe clean air, making this a clean room, so there is a huge health benefit to this box.
The reason you want to have a sound room is personal, entertainment room to be used as a game, tv, computer, internet room, to using it professionally for video conference, video blog, audio blog, audiobooks, or even making private phone calls. 

This is an office space, you can use it to read and write, call people, and basically, it becomes cubical, but not an Office-Cubical, and would be great in office spaces, and if you work on the phone, well you will never want to use a phone without a sound room, ever again, and in an office environment, this is a must-have tool, and in time, every office cubical will be replaced with one of these, so imagine having one at home, because now you can take jobs that allow a home office, once they understand this office space, they will know you can take a phone and video calls without any noise disturbance, which is normally why home jobs never work out.

This box can be used to play musical instruments that will fit, a drum set will require a 6-foot wide box, but not a problem, just add 2 feet, to the one I am showing you here, this is covered under Sizes.

What other uses can I think of for such a box like this, well if I was homeless, I would call this home, as it is, I am making an office space, and this project will show you how to make it, and I will even make it mobile, with wheels that can be used to move around the office space, but at 4 foot wide, doors are going to be hard to find.

This box is designed to make it easy to build an office space, how you use it, is up to you, but if you live in a house that is too hot to be in during the day then see the section to deal with the Air Conditioning, it is much cheaper to cool or heat 24 square feet, then it is a whole room, even a 10'x10' room is 100 square feet, plus the ceiling height.

The question is not why you want a Sound Room, because you should understand the need for personal space, and maybe a better name for it, a quiet space, yes, but a space to listen to your own thoughts in, and be able to record those thoughts into a sound recorder, without having to listen to later, and hear some background sound, and have to shot that that portion over, and hope that does not happen again, so the question you should ask yourself, is not why I want a sound room, but why I want my room sound.

Small Sound Room built around a recliner chair, with room to stand up, the concept is to have full isolation and sound dampening, 
so a vocal or instrument sound booth is used to make audio recordings, for audio or video blogs, audiobooks, videos, 
and other needs requiring a soundproof room.

This is a Do it Yourself Project (DIY), designed for people who cannot afford a Sound Room.

## Pictures

The first image is when the box is closed, it measures 7 feet tall by 4 feet wide, and a normal recliner fits inside,
the concept will include a boom mount for the recorder, and you use a laptop, smartphone, or tablet to read from.

## Features

Things that will be included in this design:

* Ventilation
* Lights
* Microphone boom
* Microphone holder
* Laptop, Smartphone, or Tablet holder

The soundproofing panels attach to a frame, this can plywood, or plastic, it requires an air gap, 
so you need two panels, plus you need to attach the soundproofing on the inside and outside.

To make this affordable, you have to make comprises, 
plywood is cheap, and the results will not be good,
the best system is to use sheets of plastic,
you can use Polycarbonate, it is the best, most expensive, I will skill Plexiglass,
because Fiberglass is cheap, lite, and can be made to make two air-tight chambers,
that will isolate loud sounds, and it is not hard to take sheet fiberglass,
shape it, and mold it, to make airtight chambers that get coupled together using neoprene spacers.
To cut down on cost, I have one source on Amazon [True Composites Fiberglass Polyester Resin-Marine Grade Repair Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Composites-Fiberglass-Repair-Polyester-1-5x50x10/dp/B079CQ8P5M), 
to give you an idea of the cost, and what you want,
this is marine grade, does not need to be, 
whatever works and is cheap.

## Concepts

The main concept for Sound Proofing is being realistic about what sounds you can remove,
I will talk about three types of sounds. 

What most people think of as Sound Proof, is hearing nothing,
that is the goal, but not practical depending on the noise.
I will call this Isolation, and we need to build a room inside a room to achieve this.

The concept of Sound Proofing has three main goals:

1. Isolation
2. Reflection
3. Background

**Isolation** is the hardest, this means you hear nothing from outside, to try to achieve this,
we will make two rooms that mount together with an isolator spacer I show in blue.

**Reflection** is what causes an echo, even in a small room, you have sounds that bounce off the walls, 
all you need is Soundproofing foam, and what most people think Soundproofing is,
but this will not give any isolation, and only add absorption of sound.

**Background noise** is on the inside, this is your equipment, 
and the ventilation system.

There are many types of Soundboards on the market, 
but I think Neoprene will work better.

What I want to achieve, is all three. Isolation, making a room inside a room, is the first step,
this requires a floor, sound can come up from the floor,
but you can skip this part, to save money, but keep in mind,
if you feel things in your home, you need this isolation from the floor.
If you cover the inside and outside with foam, you cut down on a lot of sounds,
but without the proper isolation, you still have loud sounds.

### Isolation

You will want to use Neoprene Rubber to make an Airtight outer room.

American Material Supply
[https://americanmaterialsupply.com/collections/neoprene-rubber-roll](https://americanmaterialsupply.com/collections/neoprene-rubber-roll)

The thicker the better, but the cost goes up, for <sup>1</sup>/<sub>32</sub> low grade, you are looking around $120 plus shipping.

### Reflection

The concept is to use 96, 12 inches by 12-inch Soundproof Panels, I found them for $66 at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09RKLX6RT/), 
represented by the squares, you make a frame, 
and put the panels on them, on the inside and outside, to stop sound from entering from outside, 
and to keep sound from echoing around the room you are in.

### Background

You have to deal with each type of equipment noise as you use it, the best thing is to start with everything off,
and using a sound meter, measure the inside, while holding your breath, then turn on the intake, then the exhaust, 
and use the variable speed controller to lower the sound, while still being able to breathe.

If you have a laptop, you cannot get rid of the fan noise, so a Tablet or Smartphone is a better solution, 
and you can use a fanless computer.

## Ventalation

I need two 4" inline fans, and a 4" flex hose, for intake and exhaust.

4" inline fans like these cost around $30 with a speed controller:
[4" inline fans]([https://www.amazon.com/SAILFLO-Booster-Bathroom-Basement-Greenhouse/dp/B07J5VN82X/](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZL6FDYG/)), 

![4" Fan](https://github.com/Light-Wizzard/Sound-Room/blob/main/images/fan.png)

I need some 4" flexible tubing also known as a Dryer hose is around $13 each.

![Dryer hose](https://github.com/Light-Wizzard/Sound-Room/blob/main/images/hose.png)

I show the intake as Green, it comes in from the bottom,
whereas the exhaust is taken from the top.

You will want to use a heavy wire to hold the hose in place, wire clothes hangers, or some type of holder.

You want to use insulation, you want to fully cover all the hose with insulation to prevent sound from propagating through it,
and to dampen what sounds are going through it.

## Size

The size depends on your needs, mine are simple, I want a Sound Room that my recliner will fit into, and I can stand up, 
so it needs to be 48" wide, 6' long, and 7' tall, on the outside, the inside is a few inches smaller, to allow a 1-inch air gap.

Outside:

1. Six 4'x7' outside panels
2. Two 4'x7' outside panels for sides
3. Two 3'x7' outside panels for doors

Inside:

1. Two 3.666'x5.666' top and bottom panels
2. Two 3.666'x6.71' front and back panels
3. Four 3'xx6.71' sides and doors

## Construction

I decided to make this a modular building, so I am making walls, and I have two designs for walls, 
the first is plywood, I have some, so that is what I will use, 
but I will also design what I will call Sound Isolation Panels.

I call this project a Sound-Room, it can be built in two stages,
the inside, and the outside.

The outside is called the Isolation Room, the way I want to make this,
is using Fiberglass panels,
we made an air chamber, by taking a fiberglass square tubbing, the size will make the air gap, so 1" is good,
you then add a sheet of fiberglass to the front and back, 
you make two of these and connect them using a decoupler,
Neoprene Rubber Spacers will work,
now we can use Plywood, 
and we know this will not work,
but I want to use Neoprene Rubber to wrap this panel in,
so if I wrap the fiberglass panels,
I will have a better system.

The Inside is called the Environment Room, this is suspended off of Neoprene spacers, and the outside must only connect to it, using these Sound decoupling spacers.
You have to design the front and back wall to add the mount for a monitor, depending on which way you want to look at it, this will also require exhaust air for heat, which will require a heat collector and a holder for a boom microphone, so this panel is what you will be looking at all day, and with no Windows, hang a Picture of outside, but I will not put a glass window to see through in a Sound Room, 
it defeats the purpose of a Sound Room, why not make a Glass soundproof box, it will not sound good.

The choices of material will be based on cost, and what works for you, all I can show you is what I used,
but this design is very flexible, and you can design it any way you want.

If you do not make an Isolation room, you will hear sounds from outside, 
and if you pick too thin of Neoprene, you might not have a high enough dampening rating,
so I would add a layer to the outside of the inside room.

The walls must have seals, this is going to be part of a frame, this can be made of many materials, 
Aluminum or Steel, we do not want to use wood, due to the bulk it would require to be strong enough, 
this must hold the weight of the inside and outside room, plus the person inside it.

I will not be able to document much more without building it, so this is where this project sits, till I can get parts to work on it,
because that is when I will have to deal with making with the parts I have.
