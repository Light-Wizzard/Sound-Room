# Sound-Room
Small Sound Room built around a recliner

The concept is to use 12 inch by 12 inch Soundproof Panels, represented by the squares, you make a frame, 
and put the panels on them, on the inside and outside, to stop sound from entering from outside, 
and to keep sound from echoing around the room you are in.

These images do not show the ventaltaion system yet.
